This thesis presents the work done on \Proxc{}: a CSP\hyp{}inspired concurrency library for \Cpp{}. \Proxc{} emphasizes on dynamic multithreading, allowing to create high\hyp{}performance multiprogrammed systems for multicore architectures. The thesis argues the motivation for a dynamic multithreaded library is necessary for fully utilize the available resources in the future of multicore processors. A design and implementation of \Proxc{} is presented, as well as giving examples of usage on how to use the library. A set of tests with various degrees of parallelism are benchmarked with \Proxc{} against other similar multithreaded CSP frameworks, as well as their singlecore equivalent implementations. The results from the benchmarks are promising, indicating \Proxc{} are fully capable of utilizing the available resources in most cases. However, a slight issue with the distribution of large scale parallel work with \Proxc{} is highlighted and discussed. Limitations and uses of \Proxc{} is discusses, and a list of potential future work is presented. Lastly, a conclusion is drawn.
